## Overview
The G-App Suite Timer is a simple and efficient timer application designed for the G-App Suite ecosystem. This repository contains the source code and resources for the Timer application, suitable for task timing, productivity tracking, or general time management.

## Features
- **Countdown Timer**: Set and start timers for specific durations.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/gunungpw/gapp-timer.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash

   ```
3. **Install UV**:
   Install `uv` using the official installation method. Follow the instructions for your operating system from the [official UV documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). For example, on Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS):

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
5. **Run the Application**:
   Activate the virtual environment and run the application:
   ```bash
   uv run python src/main.py
   ```
